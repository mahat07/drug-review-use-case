I have no clue if the CDS was the cause of the kidney damage, because my last blood test was decades ago. By the way, I still have zero symptoms indicating any issues with my kidneys. I still believe in CDS and its ability to cure many health issues. I merely want to suggest to proceed with your protocol slowly (maybe start with 10 ml and work up); take a day off each week to help your body (I didn't always take that day off); maybe even have a blood test after a month or so just to gauge how your body is dealing with the CDS ingestion."""

I got flagyl/metronidazole 500mg. It generally works for intestinal bacterial infection. You take 1 tablet by mouth 3 times a day for 7 days. Manufactures please make capsule form. The tablet TASTES really BAD. Take it with soda/gatorade or something that can wash away aftertaste. The side effects I felt were; nausea and dizziness. My Doctor said drink a lot of water and have it during meals and avoid all alcohol including certain mouthwash and anything that contains alcohol."""
