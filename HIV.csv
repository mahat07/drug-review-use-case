Biktarvy,10,bictegravir,antiviral combinations,50mg/200mg/25mg Once daily,Tablet,"""I have been taking Biktarvy for more than 3 months and I feel it necessary to share my experience due to the amount of negative comments about it in this forum. So, I was very afraid to make the change. I've been taking Complera since I was 20 years old, making it undetectable since 2017. I have not had any problems with this new pill. I trust that it is less harmful to the body. Don't be afraid to make the switch! Cheer up; we're all in this together.""",No
Biktarvy,9,bictegravir,antiviral combinations,50mg/200mg/25mg Once daily,Tablet,"""I was diagnosed with HIV on February 26, 2019. I had a viral load of 1,170,000+ and a CD4 count of 16. As of December 16, 2019, I am undetectable with a CD4 of 122. I have hives and a rash on my arms and shoulders, mostly when I get out of the shower, but nothing that isn't manageable with skin cream. I'm still having a hard time dealing with HIV, but I am trying to be strong. Because of this medicine, and it being one pill a day, I have not missed a dose. My insurance covers most of the cost, and a coupon covers the remaining bill. I hope they find a vaccine and one day a cure.""",No
Truvada,10,emtricitabine,antiviral combinations,200mg/300mg once daily,Tablet,"""I started Truvada once a day along with Isentress twice a day and my HIV Load was 28,000 and CD4% 31%.

Truvada,9,emtricitabine,antiviral combinations,200mg/300mg once daily,Tablet,"""I have been on the combination of Truvada/Prezista/Norvir for over 2 years now. The side effects that cause me the most problems are the ones dealing with my kidneys! The Truvada has made my GFR go down to 30, very close to changing medicines at that point. But it has been working so well that we took a very close monitoring of my kidney function, and my GFR has stabilized around 55. Other than that the side effects have been minimal to none. Great medicine overall!""",No
Descovy,8,tenofovir alafenamide systemic,antiviral combinations,200mg/10mg once daily,Tablet,"""I started taking Descovy in early 2017 and it's been about 2 years. The drug kept my viral load undetectable. I did not experience any side effects at first, but after about 1 to 1.5 years after taking it, I slowly began to experience ache in my joints and bones, and I feel tired waking up in the morning.

Brilliant, calm, methodical physician saved my life. Blood levels dropped within 2 weeks to undetectable, CD4 permanently hovering under 200. Permanent prophylaxis with Purbac DS. But in 5 years, not even a cold, no diarrhea, no more headaches. The greatest, most wonderful gift of life after the most terrible, frightening decline into the bleak realization I was full blown.

GET THE REST OF YOUR LIFE BACK.""",Yes

I immediately started Atripla, and 2 months later was undetectable. The only side effects I had were the weird dreams, and I still have them, but they can be rather enjoyable. I just call it 'a triple theater.'""",Yes

While my HIV seems to be under control, I'm finding some of the side effects are hindering my quality of life. I'm in pain every day. I've lost just about all of my body mass in the leg, arms and hip areas. I have extreme body fat in my stomach and abdominal region, also have an increase in fatty deposits in my uppermost back just below my neck.

Cabenuva,8,cabotegravir,antiviral combinations,600mg every 4 weeks,Tablet,"""It has been wonderful not having to remember to take a pill daily, but there are serious side effects for me. My hips and legs experience serious pain for a week after injections. The pain is nearly debilitating and causes me to walk with a very hard limp. I've been on Cabenuva for a year and the pain has not gotten any better. I will be switching back to the daily pill. It has been great maintaining my undetectable viral load, but the pain and side effects are just not worth it.""",No
Tenofovir alagenamide,5,emtricitabine,antiviral combinations,25mg once daily,Tablet,"""I have been on Biktarvy now for about 6 months, and the verdict is still out. I took Atripla for 7 years, and it was my miracle drug; it worked great with no side effects, but my new doctor recommended Biktarvy, saying it was better for my liver and kidneys long term because 1 of the 3 drugs was less toxic. I agreed and switched, but now I feel like I'm in a fog and have been getting lightheaded spells. My pulse has also been low, and I blacked out driving. I have had many tests and a CT scan, but everything was good. So now I am thinking Biktarvy may be the culprit. Anyone having these same side effects.""",Yes
Genvoya,6,emtricitabine,antiviral combinations,10mg/150mg/200mg.300mg once daily,Tablet,"""I've been taking Genvoya for about three months and have been experiencing some weird side effects and unsure if others have experienced as well. They are confusion, memory loss, thought process. There are some days I find myself with slow thought process, unable to articulate well or find it hard to think of words and putting them together in sentences.

cabotegravir,10,cabotegravir,antiviral combinations,30 mg once daily,Tablet,"""I had my initial injection last week. What a great sense of freedom I feel after years of taking a daily pill. I am pill-free and loving it! The injection itself did not hurt at all. However, my butt was certainly sore for three days. We will see if the same thing happens with follow up shots. I go back in a month for my first follow up shot. And it? every 2 months after that. This is a no brainer for me. I am free from pills and daily management of HIV. I am also hopeful for longer lasting treatments in the future. Thank you science (and scientists!)""",No

Reyatz,5,atazanavir,protease inhibitors,300mg/400mg once daily,Tablet,"""I can't remember how long ago it was that I began taking this drug, but it has been at least 15 years. It has, in combination with other medications, been very affective in controlling my infection. But it has given me lypohypertrophy and gynecomastia.
